# Task 6 â€“ Subqueries and Nested Queries

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Learn to use **scalar, correlated, and nested subqueries** in different clauses of SQL.

## ðŸ“‚ Tables Created
1. **Customers**
   - `customer_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `city`
2. **Orders**
   - `order_id` (Primary Key)
   - `customer_id` (Foreign Key â†’ Customers.customer_id)
   - `amount`
   - `product`

## ðŸ“Š Sample Data
- Customers: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David
- Orders: Laptop, Mouse, Keyboard, Phone, Charger

## ðŸ”— Queries Implemented
1. **Scalar Subquery** â€“ Customers with total order amount > average order amount  
2. **Correlated Subquery** â€“ Customers with an order > 10,000  
3. **Derived Table (FROM Subquery)** â€“ Top spenders by total orders  
4. **Subquery with IN** â€“ Customers who ordered Laptop/Phone  
5. **Scalar Subquery with =** â€“ Customer who placed the max order  

## âœ… Key Concepts
- **Subquery**: Query inside another query  
- **Scalar Subquery**: Returns a single value  
- **Correlated Subquery**: Depends on outer query values  
- **Derived Table**: Subquery in `FROM` clause  

## âš¡ Tools Used
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench
